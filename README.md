# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python

This repo is based on this great FREE course by Udacity [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513)

I changed some implementations to make it easier to understand and also, added some more examples.

## About this Course
Technical interviews follow a pattern. If you know the pattern, youâ€™ll be a step ahead of the competition. This course will introduce you to common data structures and algorithms in Python. You'll review frequently-asked technical interview questions and learn how to structure your responses.

You will answer practice problems and quizzes to test your abilities. Then you'll practice mock interviews to get specific recommendations for improvement. Be ready for anything the technical interviewer throws at you.
